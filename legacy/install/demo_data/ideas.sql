This often causes confusion, delays in responses, and difficulties in tracking important information.\n\nI propose adopting a single, unified internal communication tool that integrates messaging, video conferencing, and project collaboration features. This would help streamline communication, reduce the number of missed updates, and improve overall efficiency.\n\nBusiness Impact:\n* Faster and clearer communication between teams\n* Reduced information loss across different platforms\n* Improved transparency and accountability\n* Enhanced collaboration, especially for remote and hybrid teams\n\nNext Steps / Recommendation:\nI suggest running a pilot program with one of the leading communication platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) within a specific department for three months. Based on results, the solution can then be scaled across the organization.','0','7451ac0d-c4d1-04f6-4666-5ce3c54ff383','new','','b5dcff6f-1a14-56bf-eecd-5ce3c791a112');
